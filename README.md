The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict a personâ€™s personality type based on their written text using the MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) framework. The MBTI classifies personalities into 16 distinct types based on four dichotomies:

Introversion (I) / Extraversion (E)

Intuition (N) / Sensing (S)

Thinking (T) / Feeling (F)

Judging (J) / Perceiving (P)

Given a dataset containing user-generated text (e.g., social media posts) labeled with MBTI types, the task is to apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the text, extract meaningful linguistic features, and build a model that classifies the text into the correct personality type or its components (e.g., I/E, N/S, T/F, J/P). The solution should involve text cleaning, feature engineering, and the use of machine learning or deep learning algorithms to capture patterns in language that correlate with personality traits.

The end goal is to demonstrate how written language can be a reliable indicator of personality, enabling applications in personalized recommendations, hiring, mental health assessment, and social media analysis.
